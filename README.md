# Human Activity Recognition
## B.Sc, Computer Engineering final project
### General Information

The [public domain dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) used in this project was published with [an article](https://www.esann.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/legacy/es2013-84.pdf) that used an SVM model and 500+ human-engineered features for classification. In addition to the human-engineered features, a relatively-raw dataset was added as well. I used these raw samples for my final project.

The project's goals were:
- deepen my knowledge and understanding of Machine Learning as a whole, and deep dive into Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
- learn and experiment with Convolutional Neural Networks and with Long Short-Term Memory networks.
<br>
This is a supervised multivariate time-series classification problem implemented with Google Colaboratory.

A big thank-you to [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/), whose books and blogs provided great resources and guidance for me during this project.

I recommend checking the project's book (in the repo's root, as a PDF) - I tried explaining and understanding the behavior exhibited by the different models and architectures, and had a lot of fun on the way!

### Technicalities
- If you want to run the code yourself, all you need to do after cloning the repo is correcting the path to the UCI HAR Dataset directory in the notebooks. I used Google Colaboratory, so I added the option to either fetch the dataset from Google Drive or from a local directory on your machine.
